Created acording to the documentation supplied @ http://salsify.github.io/line-server

Using Ruby 3.0.2
Made in Xubuntu 22.04 LTS (Based on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS) after fresh installation
Development environment made with docker

Run "build.sh" for installation of docker with the script from https://get.docker.com/ and building of docker image.
The same file is also prepared for a native installation using ruby3.0 from ubuntu's package manager, using the flag '--native'.

To execute, run "run.sh", followed by the file to be used. This script will detect a valid docker install and subsequent docker image to execute the rails server OR run it in native mode.
